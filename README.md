The pollution of water bodies around the world and its repercussions
Water bodies around the world are being contaminated and polluted by toxic chemical
wastes and refuse. Toxic chemical wastes and refuse have certain characteristics to
them, namely, ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, and toxicity, and some examples include
oil spills, heavy metals from industrial activity, and waste materials discarded by
humans.
In our current world, water bodies make up about 70% of the earth, and they are also
the most common sources of the world’s water supply. Apart from that, these water
bodies are also home to 15% of the world’s marine life and ecosystem, and they are the
main sources that drive certain recreational and agricultural industries. However, even
though 70% of the earth is made up of water bodies, human’s access to drinkable water
is finite. Less than 1% of the earth’s freshwater is accessible to us. There are many
reasons why we only have access to 1% of the earth’s freshwater, but the most
pressing issue that we have is caused by us humans, and that is water pollution.
Water pollution happens when toxic and harmful substances like chemicals contaminate
the water bodies (lakes, river, ocean, etc.) and causes the quality of these water bodies
to degrade and thus becoming toxic to marine life, humans, and the environment. About
80% of the world’s water waste is being dumped back into our water bodies, making it
more contaminated, polluted, and inhabitable. These harmful substances will remain as
contaminants in our water bodies which jeopardizes our chances of increased access to
fresh water.
Statistics show that polluted and unsafe water kills more people each year than war and
all other forms of violence combined. Water pollution and unsafe water caused 1.8
million deaths in 2015 and sickens about 1 billion people every year. It is also estimated
that 1 million tons of oil is being dumped into marine environments each year and these
come from many different sources like factories, farms, and city areas. Oil tanker spills
or leakage account for 10% of the oil in water bodies around the world. Apart from this,
radioactive substances from nuclear plants, hospitals, and even the military would
expect to cost more than $100 billion, to clean up 56 million gallons of wastes.
If water pollution continues to rapidly increase as industrialisation advances, with
minimal preventive measures, there will be repercussions on human health and the
environment. Waterborne pathogens from human and animal wastes are significant
causes of illness from these contaminated water. Diseases such as cholera and typhoid 
are widespread around the world today. Less developed countries like Ethiopia and
Somalia lack proper access to safe drinking water and are more susceptible to
waterborne disease, especially children who have weaker immune systems. In more
developed countries like the United States, thousands of people fall ill every year due to
Legionnaires’ disease, which is a severe form of pneumonia contracted from water
sources. Heavy metal pollutants such as arsenic and mercury are getting into our water
supplies from industrial pollutants. When ingested, these toxins can cause an array of
health issues from cancer to hormone disruption and altered brain functions.

Water pollution also affects the environment detrimentally. It can cause an algal bloom
in lakes or marine environments, which in turn reduces the oxygen levels in the water.
This would threaten the marine ecosystem and create “dead zones” which are basically
areas of water bodies that would not encourage marine life to thrive. Chemicals and
heavy metal pollutants from industrial wastes would be toxic to marine life, often
reducing their lifespan and ability to reproduce. These heavy metals ingested would
also move along the food chain which is why bigger prey like tuna would accumulate
large amounts of mercury. Lastly, the marine ecosystem is also affected by waste
refuse, such as plastic bags and soda cans. This solid debris that is not bio-degradable
will remain as contaminates for an indefinite amount of time. For example, the
discarding of fishing gear, and many other forms of non-bio-degradable debris are
responsible for harming about 200 species of marine life, from turtles to whales.
Currently, there are several preventive measures in place to help eliminate and reduce
these toxic chemicals and human wastes, which include floating contraptions and water
treatment plants. However, these methods lack the efficiency and effectiveness to curb
the worsening situation. With industrialization advancing, we need to propose a more
refined and effective solution that is able to keep up with the advancement of
industrialization.
Overall, water pollution by toxic chemical wastes and refuse is a pressing issue as it
affects not only the environment but human health as well. It requires immediate
interventive measures that can protect one of our most important natural resources.
